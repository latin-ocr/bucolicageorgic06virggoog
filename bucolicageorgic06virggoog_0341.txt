Bathyllus vves retfuested to complete'the verses, but vves un
ehle to do it. Virgi then wrote thern out thus:

llos ego versiculos leci, tulit alter honores.
Sic vos non vobis nidificetis aves.
sic voc nou vobis vellera fenis oves.
' Sic vos nou vobis mellificatise .
Sic vos uon vobis sertis staua ἵνα.

And thereby proved himself the authores the distich, to the no
small annoyance of Bathyllus, who ailerwerds became the suh
ject of much ridicule. Ι

As Virgil was one of the most benevolcut and virtuous men ol
tlte ege,sohe lived beloved‚ and died universal] lementcd. Just
before his death, he is said to heve written for himself this very
modest ond expressive epitaph: ·

· hleotua me genuit : Calabri rapuere ι tenet nunc
Parthenope : cecini pascue, mrs,duces.

Notwithstanding the pre-eminent natural endowments ol' Vir-
gil, he unquestiouabl owed much to circumstances, and the age
in which he lived. lic flourished in the brightest era of Roman
literature. Several distin ished scholare and men of genius
had immediately preceded im, and he was cotemlporary with
Nepos, Sallust, Livy, Pro rtius, Tibullus, Ouid, orace, and
Phaedrus With severalo these he lived in habits of personal
intimacy and friendship.

The refineinent and moral purity of his writings, no less than Ἴ ’ l

the elegance and e'xquisite polish of his style, render the works
of virgil, above all others ot' the age, suiteble for the study aad
contemplationes youth.
