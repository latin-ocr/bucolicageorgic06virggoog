teeu years before Christ. His body w'as conveyed to Naples at

tune to Maeeeuas, Tucca, aud Augustus, the last of whom ho
appointed his executor. He enjoined it on his executor to burn

the AEueid, ashehad not been able to revise it. But in this -

Augustus⁴ saw fit to depart from his instructions 3 aud committed

the poem to Tucca and Vama, with directions to revise aud ·

erese whatever they s'aw fit, but expressly forbade their adding
any thing, even to the unfiuished verses. This is probably the
reason that there are so many unfinished verses, especially to-
wards the close. Virgil was sleuder, and rather tall, his oom-
plexion swarthy‚and his constitution sickly. Hewasexceediugly
temperate, aud paid little attention to dress, was modest aud
bashful to the extreme, so ruach so that he often took shelter iu
shops, or any retreat at haud, to screeu ¹himself from the gaze

Virgil wrote the following distich, and placed it, in the night,
over the palace gete of Augustus, not intending to he known as

blessings of his reign, by seying that he ah with Jove the

'empireof theworl. Inquirieswere made forthe authorh his
order3 but, as Virgil was too diffident to discover himsel , the
verses were claime by Bathyllus, a very ordinary poet of the
tirus, who received a splendid reward from Augustus. This
was more than Virgil would allow. ,He accordingly wrote the

distich again, aud placed auderit the following:
Hos ego versiculos-

aud the beginning of another verse in these words,

. ste vos non robia- four times repeated.
